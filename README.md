# Web-Design-Recipe-Project
This project was developed as part of the Web Design course at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Eau Claire. The assignment involved creating a fully functional website for a hypothetical client. My group chose to build a dynamic Recipe Website that allows users to browse, search, and view various recipes, while meeting all technical requirements of the course.
